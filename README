To build from a Git clone:
  ./autogen.sh
  mkdir build && cd build
  ../configure
  make
  make install

To use a specific version of LLVM add
  --with-llvm=/path/to/llvm-config
to the configure command. LLVM 3.0 or later is required.

To run the regression tests:
  make check
Note you may need to install additional Ruby libraries:
  gem install colorize getopt

To recompile the standard libraries:
  make -C lib clean
  make bootstrap
Note this happens automatically when installing.

See lib/ieee/README for details on building the IEEE libraries.
