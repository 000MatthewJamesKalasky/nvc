NVC is a GPLv3 VHDL compiler and simulator

See these posts for more information:
  http://www.doof.me.uk/category/vhdl/

To build from a Git clone:
  ./autogen.sh
  mkdir build && cd build
  ../configure
  make
  make install

Generating the configure script requires autoconf and automake
version 1.12 or later.

To use a specific version of LLVM add
  --with-llvm=/path/to/llvm-config
to the configure command. LLVM 3.0 or later is required.

NVC also depends on flex and bison to generate the parser. The bison
version should be at least 2.5.

If a readline-compatible library is installed it will be used to provide
line editing in the interactive mode.

To run the regression tests:
  make check
The unit tests require the 'check' library:
  http://check.sourceforge.net/
Note you may need to install additional Ruby libraries:
  gem install colorize getopt

To recompile the standard libraries:
  make -C lib clean
  make bootstrap
Note this happens automatically when installing.

See lib/ieee/README for details on building the IEEE libraries.
